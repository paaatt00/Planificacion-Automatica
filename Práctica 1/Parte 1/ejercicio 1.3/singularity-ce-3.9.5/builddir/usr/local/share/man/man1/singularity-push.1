.SH NAME
.PP
singularity-push - Upload image to the provided URI


.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
\fBsingularity push [push options...]  \fP


.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The 'push' command allows you to upload a SIF container to a given
  URI.  Supported URIs include:

.PP
library:
      library://user/collection/container[:tag]

.PP
oras:
      oras://registry/namespace/repo:tag

.PP
NOTE: It's always good practice to sign your containers before
  pushing them to the library. An auth token is required to push to the library,
  so you may need to configure it first with 'singularity remote'.
