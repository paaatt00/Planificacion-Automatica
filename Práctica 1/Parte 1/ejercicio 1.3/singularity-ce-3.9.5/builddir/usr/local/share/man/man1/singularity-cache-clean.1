.SH NAME
.PP
singularity-cache-clean - Clean your local Singularity cache


.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
\fBsingularity cache clean [clean options...]\fP


.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This will clean your local cache (stored at $HOME/.singularity/cache if
  SINGULARITY_CACHEDIR is not set). By default the entire cache is cleaned, use
  --days and --type flags to override this behavior. Note: if you use Singularity
  as root, cache will be stored in '/root/.singularity/.cache', to clean that
  cache, you will need to run 'cache clean' as root, or with 'sudo'.


.SH OPTIONS
.PP
\fB-D\fP, \fB--days\fP=0
	remove all cache entries older than specified number of days

.PP
\fB-n\fP, \fB--dry-run\fP[=false]
	operate in dry run mode and do not actually clean the cache

.PP
\fB-f\fP, \fB--force\fP[=false]
	suppress any prompts and clean the cache

.PP
\fB-h\fP, \fB--help\fP[=false]
	help for clean

.PP
\fB-T\fP, \fB--type\fP=[all]
	a list of cache types to clean (possible values: library, oci, shub, blob, net, oras, all)
