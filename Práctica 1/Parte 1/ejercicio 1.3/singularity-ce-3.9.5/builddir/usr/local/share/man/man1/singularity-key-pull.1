.SH NAME
.PP
singularity-key-pull - Download a public key from a key server


.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
\fBsingularity key pull [pull options...] \fP


.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The 'key pull' command allows you to retrieve public key material from a
  remote key server, and add it to your keyring. Note that Singularity consults
  your keyring when running commands such as 'singularity verify', and thus
  adding a key to your keyring implies a level of trust. Because of this, it is
  recommended that you verify the fingerprint of the key with its owner prior
  to running this command.

\fB-g\fP, \fB--global\fP[=false]
	manage global public keys (import/pull/remove are restricted to root user or unprivileged installation only)

.PP
\fB-h\fP, \fB--help\fP[=false]

.PP
